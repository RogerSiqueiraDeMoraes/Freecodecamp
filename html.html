        <p>
            
            PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

            Nice, but what does that mean? An example:

        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitulo">Example #1 An introductory example</h3>
        <pre><code>
            
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;

        &lt;?php
            echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
        ?&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </pre></code>
<p>
Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does something (in this case, output Hi, I'm a PHP script!). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow jumping in and out of PHP mode.
</p>
<p>
What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. A web server can even be configured to process all HTML files with PHP, and then there's no way that users can tell that PHP is being used.
</p>
<p>
The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's features. With PHP, almost anyone can get up and running and be writing simple scripts in no time at all.

Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, much more can be done with it. Read on, and see more in the What can PHP do? section, or go right to the introductory tutorial to jump straight to learning about web programming.

        <p>
            Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so it can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.

        <p>There are two main areas where PHP scripts are used.</p>
